        <p>A <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are
            securely linked together
            via cryptographic hashes. <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block <del>contains</del> consists a
            cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a
            Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about
            the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each
            additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible
            in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without
            altering all subsequent blocks.

    <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a <mark>peer-to-peer (P2P)</mark> computer network for use as a public
        distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new
        transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible,
        blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
        fault tolerance.[5]

    <p> A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
        to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
        Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it
        the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or
        central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by
        the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[7]

    <h2><b>History</b></h2>

    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[13]</p>
<p>every week since 1995.[13]

    The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]
    
    In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]
    
    The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]</p>
